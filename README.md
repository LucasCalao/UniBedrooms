**Development of the UniBedrooms application**

 The aim of this work is to develop a system for renting rooms in the residences of students at universities in the European Union.
  
**Description of the problem**

The aim is to create an application that makes it easier to search for and rent rooms in student residences at universities in the European Union.
  There are two types of users: university students and residence managers. students can apply for a room in several residences of their choice. Students are not limited to applying for rooms in their university's residences. They can also apply to rent rooms at other universities.
  Managers use the system to enter rooms (which are from their university's residences), and then enter vacancies in those rooms. The allocation of rooms to students is done by the residence managers and they can choose any of the students who applied for the room.
  
The main features of this application are:
  - register a student e or manager g;
  - register a room q in a residence;
  - register a vacancy, i.e. indicate that a particular room q is free;
  - consult available rooms in a locality l;
  - register a student's application to rent a room q;
  - consult candidates for a room q;
  - allocate a room q to an applicant e.
